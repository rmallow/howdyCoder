The first argument to the function should be: data_set. If the user requires a function that does data manipulation then that data should come from data_set.
For example if the user asks for the average of the prices then the function would get the prices from data_set["price"].
Any changes made to data_set will not be saved. Do not make changes to data_set that are expected to be used later.
data_set will always be a dictionary of lists. Always access data_set by: data_set["keyName"]
Do not access data_set by a passed in parameter/argument, always use a string constant to access data_set like "text", "number", "price", etc.
If you only want the first value from a data_set column: data_set["keyName"][0]
If you only want the last value from a data_set column: data_set["keyName"][-1]
Assume that the period for any calculations is the length of the list in the data_set.
Any time the user refers to data, assume that this will come out of the data_set variable.
Always access data_set with a string, such as "prices" or "text". Do not access data_set with a variable.
The first argument should always be data_set. If the user refers to data, this should always come from data_set.
